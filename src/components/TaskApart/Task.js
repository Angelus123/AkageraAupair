                  family, depending on the age and number of children
                   and the parents' work situation. For example, 
                   if the children are older and out of the house a lot,
                    the au pair can of course be expected to do more
                     housework than childcare, so that, for example, 
                     ironing the parents' laundry can be added. Tasks that
                      are expected from the au pair are discussed before 
                      the placement, but flexibility, helpfulness, and
                       willingness to compromise are expected from 
                       the Aupair.I
