                Au Pair program 
                The term "au pair" is derived from the French "au pair", which means "mutual". 
                An au pair decides to go abroad with the aim of improving the language skills of the host country, in some cases even learning new things. 
                A foreign host family offers an au pair pocket money and free board and lodging in their own home for the duration of their stay. In return, 
                the au pair helps the host family with childcare and light household chores. Both the au pair and the host family benefit from an au pair stay. 
                The Au Pair program is the right choice if you want to learn about the way of life of other nations and improve your language skills.
                You will become more independent through the Au Pair program and learn to stand on your own two feet without having to completely 
                renounce the family environment. By having free board and lodging with your host family, you keep your cost of living relatively low.
