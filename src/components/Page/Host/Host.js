              A Host Family is a family willing to host an Aupair under the host country’s official program. As Host Family you must meet certain requirements in order to join the program. For instance, you must have a child under 18 years old, the ability to host an Aupair in your home and respect the Host Family responsibilities during the program. 
              You, as  a Host Family offers an Aupair the pocket money, free board and lodging in their own home for the duration of their stay. 
              In return, the Aupair girl/boy helps the Host Family with childcare and light household chores. Both the Aupair and the Host Family benefit from an Aupair progam. 
              The Aupair program is the right choice if you want to learn about the way of life of other nations and get the support in child care and household management.  According to the program requirements, the Aupair will have to learn or improve his/her knowledge of the host country’s language. To make it possible, the Host Family needs to speak this language at home.  In addition to this, you will need to find an Aupair of a different nationality than your own to respect the cultural exchange aspect.

                The following tasks are not part of the Aupair's area of ​​responsibility: 

                The Aupair’s main responsibility is to take care of the Host Family’s children as well as to perform tasks related to childcare. Aupairs do not have to cook for the host parents, clean their rooms that are exclusively used by the host parents or take care of someone else’s children, among others, gardening, clean windows, spring cleaning, clean carpets, car wash 
                weekly shopping for the whole family, education of the pet, cooking for the whole family * 
                ironing for the parents *, make parents' beds *keep parents' bathroom clean * 

                *The tasks expected of the Aupair vary from family to family, depending on the age and number of children and the parents' work situation. For example, if the children are older and out of the house a lot, the au pair can of course be expected to do more housework than childcare, so that, for example, ironing the parents' laundry can be added. 

                Tasks that are expected from the Aupair are discussed before the placement, but flexibility, helpfulness, and willingness to compromise are expected from the Aupair and the Host Family. </p>
